# Welcome to Holly Larson Capelo's Repository

## About Me
I'm an astrophysicist deeply engaged in interdisciplinary projects spanning space science, solar system exploration, and fluid dynamics. My expertise lies in designing and testing apparatus for low-gravity conditions, pushing the boundaries of exploration and discovery.

## Expertise
I bring proficiency in a range of techniques and methodologies including:
- SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Interfaces) Protocol
- TCP/IP Programming
- High-Performance Parallel Computing
- Data Science Toolkit (Python, R, SQL)
- Data Wrangling
- Statistical Techniques
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning
- MLOps

## Collaboration
I'm actively seeking collaborations on projects focused on machine vision and autonomous control of hardware, particularly in remote vehicles like flight vehicles on Earth or within the context of space exploration.

## Project examples
- [Instrumentation](https://https://github.com/hlc-astro/TEMPusVoLA)
- [Scientific Data Analysis](https://github.com/hlc-astro/permeability_scripts)
- [Data Science Bootcamp](https://github.com/hlc-astro/data_science_bootcamp)
