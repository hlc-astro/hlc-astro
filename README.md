# You are in the personal repository of Holly Larson Capelo. 
## I am an astrophysicist currently working on interdisciplinary projects in space science, Solar-system exploration, and fluid dynamics. I am also very involved in the design and testing of apparatus which operate in low-gravity conditions. 

### I am familiar with the following techniques and methodologies:
- SCPI (Standard commands for programmable interfaces) protocol
- TCP-IP programming
- high-performance parallel computing
- Data Science Toolkit (Python, R, SQL)
- Data Wrangling
- Statistical Techniques
- Machine Learning
- Data Visualization
- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning
- MLops

## I am looking to collaborate on projects related to machine vision and/or autonomous control of hardware (measurement sensors, data acquisition and transfer, maneuvering) in remote vehicles such as flight vehicles on Earth, or in a space context.
